# react-simple-webpage

As request, I made a simple webpage in React, the React environment is set up using Webpack and Babel from scratch.

## Running locally

- `git clone` this repo
- `cd react-simple-webpage`
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- `npm run dev` to fire up Webpack and a local server that will refresh automatically when the code changes.
- open `http://localhost:8080` to view to the webpage.

## Tests

Run `npm test` to run the tests with Jest.
